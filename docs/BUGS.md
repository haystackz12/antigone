## Known platform quirks (not bugs, just notes)
- **Linux `fs.watch`**: fires duplicate events per save. Debounce to 200ms on Linux. Detect platform in main.js: `process.platform === 'linux'`.
- **macOS `app.on('open-file')`**: fires before app is ready if file is double-clicked from Finder. Store the path in a variable and handle it in `app.whenReady()`.
- **Windows NSIS installer**: requires administrator privileges for file association registration. Document in README.
- **CodeMirror 6 and IME input** (CJK languages): use `EditorView.domEventHandlers` for composition events if non-Latin input breaks inline rendering decorations.
